question1_text <- "How does the map compare to your prediction? Where is 
overall species richness the greatest? In what watershed(s) does richness 
appear to be highest? Is it in just one location? More than one location?
Explain."

question2_text <- "Which region(s) of the U.S. showed the greatest richness?
Are they northern? Eastern U.S.? Mostly along a coastline? Give examples of 
2-3 families that had similar distributions. Which families had different
distributions compared to those 2-3 you just discussed?"

question3_text <- "Is the distribution of species richness observed here
consistent with what you learned in the Rapoport exercises? Consider for
example the bubble plot and the plot that showed the latitude of maximum
species richness in the U.S."
